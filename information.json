The brain also commands certain muscle to stretch, or certain organs to do things. This was an example, of course.\n\nThe brain may look very weird at first, but the shape defines how it works. The brain (like all organs) also needs blood to work. But if too much blood is put, this organ may leak/swell, or this organ might not be able to be used.\n\nThe organ's stats are listed below.\n\nName: Brain\nIs an organ: Yes\nUse: Working like a mind, controlling certain parts, etc.\nIs sensitive: VERY sensitive\nNeeds: Blood, oxygen, nutrients\n\nFun facts: Alcohol can affect the neurons and decisions for this brain, making the brain badly modify-able.\n\nA brain looks like:\n",

So if too much smoke is in the lungs, the smoke can even tear the skin apart, or cause the organ swelling.\n\nName: Lungs\nIs an organ: Yes (because the lungs are used for other things) and no (because this doesn't use blood)\nUse: Storing oxygen, storing air\nIs sensitive: Sensitive\nNeeds: Nutrients, vitamins\n\nLungs look like:",
